Merkle Smart Contract
This is a Solidity smart contract implementation of a Merkle drop mechanism, allowing users to claim ERC1155 tokens by providing a valid Merkle proof.

Description
The Merkle smart contract is designed to facilitate the distribution of ERC1155 tokens using a Merkle tree. It allows users to claim their tokens by providing a Merkle proof generated off-chain.

Features
Efficient distribution of ERC1155 tokens using a Merkle tree.
Prevents duplicate claims by tracking claimed addresses.
Easy integration with off-chain Merkle tree generation tools.
Supports dynamic token URI retrieval for improved flexibility.
Getting Started
To use this smart contract in your project, follow these steps:

Deploy the Contract: Deploy the Merkle.sol contract to your Ethereum network of choice. Make sure to provide the Merkle root hash during deployment.

Whitelist Users: Generate a Merkle tree off-chain including the addresses eligible for claiming tokens and their respective amounts. Compute the Merkle root hash and provide it during contract deployment.

Claim Tokens: Users can claim their tokens by providing a valid Merkle proof, proving their eligibility for the tokens.
